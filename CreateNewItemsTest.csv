Many organizations have automated the receipt, entry, processing and output of countless types of documents – from invoices, claims forms and mortgage applications, to emails, mailroom documents, onboarding documents and more.</p><p>In the process, organizations have reaped the benefits: shaving cost and time out of information-intensive, externally facing processes, reducing errors and ensuring compliance. These benefits have also gone a long way toward improving customer engagement.</p><p>In just five years, information capture is tackling innovative use cases that, through technology advances, had never been possible before. There’s a buzz being generated about new frontiers opening up for information capture around the cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). </p><p>This six-part blog series will review where the capture industry has been, examine how capture solves document and data processing problems today, and reveal where capture technology is headed.</p><p>Let’s  explore five areas of information capture evolution:</p><ul><li><b>1990s – Batch capture</b>      <ul>       <li>Centralized, high-volume document imaging for sharing and archival</li>      </ul></li><li><b>2000s – Multi-channel capture, distributed capture, mailroom capture</b>      <ul>       <li>Document imaging, classification and extraction from any source (email, web, MFP, scanner, fax, folder, etc.)</li>       <li>Lower-volume document capture at branch and remote offices</li>       <li>Document capture for mailrooms, BPOs and shared service centers</li>       <li>Machine learning of documents for initial and ongoing system training</li>      </ul></li><li><b>2010s – Mobile capture, electronic data capture </b>      <ul>       <li>Document imaging, classification and extraction from mobile devices for immediate, effective customer engagement</li>       <li>Data capture from electronic data sources such as websites, databases/ERPs, desktop apps, using robotic process automation (RPA)</li>      </ul></li><li><b>2010s – Digital transformation </b>      <ul>       <li>Document capture in the context of a larger, externally facing business process that is also digitalized</li>       <li>Automation technologies beyond capture, including process and case management, RPA, electronic signatures and customer communications management</li>      </ul></li><li><b>Today and into the 2020s – Capture as a service, AI-based capture </b>      <ul>       <li>Pre-configured, document type-specific imaging, classification and extraction in the cloud, available as a service</li>       <li>Mimicking human understanding of content in documents, emails and social streams through AI-based technologies for automating processes and assisting with human decisionmaking</li>      </ul></li></ul><p>Although the technology has evolved over time, all five of these capture use cases deliver business value today.</p><h4>Capture Your Content and Capture Control</h4><p>Believe it or not, many companies are not harnessing the power of information capture.
